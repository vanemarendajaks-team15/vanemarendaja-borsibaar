#### Tiimi liikmed:

- Andrus Naulainen | andrus14
- Karel Maarma | Maarma
- Margus Käen | mkaen

#### Workflow:

- feature branches
- pull requests
- review by one team member
- Mentor should preview tickets in Jira and approve before developer starts to resolve

#### Used merge strategies
- Regular merge - Most simple merge method to use
- Squash merge - Unnecessary to keep changes in git history

#### Encountered problems
- Modified database migration file and failed to run application after that
- Created remote repo in to personal github account. Then discovered that it's better to use organization github account and moved repository there.
- Created conflict through pull request to edit same file and row at the same time
- Couldn't start the application at the first try
- Changed branches ruleset multiple times to merge branches to main branch
